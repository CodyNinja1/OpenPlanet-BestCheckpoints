Looking to partly emulate the F1 sector times

lots of options in the settings.

Compare your best checkpoint times from each run to your current run

Includes a theoretical best time if your were to get a run with your best checkpoint times

By default it only updates your best times when you finish a run With an option in the settings to save on half completed runs

Saves your best times to load whenever you come back to the map
